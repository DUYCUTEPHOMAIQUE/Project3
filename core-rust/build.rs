// Note: Flutter Rust Bridge codegen is typically run via CLI or IDE integration
// Build script is kept simple for now - codegen will be done separately
fn main() {
    // Optional: Add other build-time checks or configurations here
    // For flutter_rust_bridge, codegen is usually done via:
    // `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen` CLI tool or IDE integration
